## Hooks #6 </br> 
Read the puzzle description here: 

The grid presented here can be partitioned into 9 L-shaped “hooks”. The largest is 9-by-9 (contains 17 squares), the next largest is 8-by-8 (contains 15 squares), and so on. The smallest hook is just a single square. Find where the hooks are located, and place nine 9’s in the largest hook, eight 8’s in the next-largest, etc., down to one 1 in the smallest hook.
The filled squares must form a connected region. (Squares are “connected” if they are orthogonally adjacent.) Furthermore, every 2-by-2 region must contain at least one unfilled square.
A black number outside the grid indicates the product of the concatenated numbers in that row or column, when viewed from that position. (See the example, below.) A red number indicates the greatest common factor of these concatenated numbers, again when viewed from that position.
